I'm learning React

### my story

My intrest to the coding started when I was writing on my weblog, at the time which I was 12 years old and I'm looking for templates of HTML and CSS.
seeing those codes made me curious what are those thing
In 18 , I've found out that those codes are HTML ,then , I was trying to learn them,now I'm much more serious about programming and I begined 
learning c# to figure out what the basic of programming is and right after that I understood that I'm intersred in web developing and I started
learning js.



### I wanna learn and code more and more.
